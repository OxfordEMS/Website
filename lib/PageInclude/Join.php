<h3 class="text-md-center">Support Team</h3>
<div class="text-md-center">If the medical aspect of the Oxford Emergency Squad isn't for you and you still want to help, join the support team.
    The Support Team's primary function is to assist with fundraising activities.  They also assist the Squad Members at the scenes of time consuming calls such as fires and large scale incidents.
    They support the Squad by providing necessary items such as food and water at these scenes.  Support Team members are not EMT's, but still wish to help serve the community.</div>
<h3 class="text-md-center">Training</h3>
<div class="text-md-center">Volunteer members undergo approximately 220 hours of intensive training to become EMTs (Emergency Medical Technicians).
    EMT training includes all procedures necessary for basic life support, assisting paramedics with advanced life support, and defibrillator training.
    All trained members are required to maintain their qualifications with mandatory training on an ongoing basis.
    This consists of 48 continuing education training hours every 3 years to maintain the State EMT Certification.
    Many other mandatory squad hours include drills, maintenance of equipment, parades and other related classes.</div>
